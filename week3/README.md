# Week 3 👨🏾‍💻👨🏾‍💻

## This week
I'm currently working on a project for a meetup and studying for interviews in addition to this so I will actually shift my focus to that and work on my optional homeworks when I have time.

### Homework (optional)
Build a English to spanish translator for my friend, Sri, so he can finish his homework.
