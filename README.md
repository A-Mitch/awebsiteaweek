# A Website a Week üï∏
This is where I will be practicing, having fun with, and learning all things web.

I have always wanted to make wesites and web applications ever since I could remember and became really interested in how I could create them during my time in college. I made a few websites for class in college as well as during an internship, but I know and feel like there is a lot that I have to learn, so I am using this repository and my imagination to do just that! ü§©

I truly see the impact of websites and web applications in the world around us and even in my daily life. I can't tell you how many times I access Gmail, YouTube, or GitHub a day because you would probably judge me (üòÇüòÖ). Seeing how often my colleagues and I access various web applications daily let's me know that I can have an impact as well.

tl;dr: Websites and web applications are everywhere and I have always wanted to make them, so I am using this good 'ole imagination of mine paired with my programming skills to have fun and make kick ass things.

# How I am structuring this üóÑ
Homework: One small assignment created for myself that will incorporate many elements of the web.
> - Homework problems are going to be random problems/ scenarios that pop up in my head, hence why they come with stories/scenarios.

Study: This consists of topic or topics that I am studying for the week. My goal is to understand them and how they work in the web ecosystem.

Element: This consists element or elements that I am studying for the week. I will create something or multiple things that encompass this element so that way I can understand how it works, how to style it, and "what makes it tick".

Summary: I am going to recount what I learned each week and what challenges I faced and how I overcame them

Summaries will be posted on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@amitchellofficial).

# Ultimate Goal üí™üèΩ
To become a better and confident programmer as well as a better thinker and crafter when it comes to creating a program/ anything. I want to think about who I am making this for and how what I create may be able to help them in anyway. With this repositiory I want to push myself to learn modern web programming, design, and frameworks and to get over my ridiculous and irrational fear of JavaScript (which is similar to my fear of Python, which is now long gone -- [Shameless self plug](https://github.com/A-Mitch/apythonaday)). 

I want to leverage what I learned in school and what I have in my imagination to create fun things that I or someone else that I might not even know would use. Overall, this will help me with my confidence and versatility when it comes to progamming in various environments and languages because as Doctor Mitch would say, "A website a week keeps your mind on its feet and ensures that your coding skills aren't meek."
